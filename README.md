# ezHTMLPrint
A open source project that allows the user to echo HTML in PHP without having to echo a long sentence. Everyone is welcomed to contribute. 
Disclaimer: Doing this may not be best practice, but I am writing this for the sake of convenience of programmers who would rather print HTML in PHP Codes.

## Getting Started
To use the ezHTMLPrint class, you just need to download the file and put it into the folder where you would usually put your classes. The methods
inside ezHtmlPrint are all static and could be called using this way

```
ezHTMLPrint::<method>
```

## Features
On top of helping user print HTML codes in the PHP code block, I added checks to ensure that the tags are balanced. This will help the user to easier 
debug any missing tags and to add it back in

## Contributing
I welcome any programmer/coder to contribute to this project!
